# The Lego Collector's Dilemma

This project is completely based on linear regression model.

## Problem Statement :

You are a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as you can. But before that you wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue. Since (luckily!), you are a data scientist in the making, you wished to solve this problem yourself. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.

## About the dataset :

The dataset has details of 12261 lego sets with the following 10 features :
age - Which age categories it belongs to

list_price - price of set in dollars

num_reviews - number of reviews per set

piece_count - number of pieces in that lego set

playstarrating - ratings

review_difficulty - difficulty level of the set

star_rating - ratings

theme_name - which theme it belongs

valstarrating - ratings

country - country name

## Approach taken to solve the problem :

1) Data loading and splitting : Loading the dataset and splitting the data into train and test.

2) Scatter plot : check the scatter_plot for different features vs target variable list_price. This tells us which features are highly      correlated with the target variable list_price and help us predict it better.

3) Remove highly correlated columns : Features highly correlated with each other adversely affect our lego pricing model. Thus we keep      a inter-feature correlation threshold of 0.75. If two features are correlated and with a value greater than 0.75, remove one of          them.

4) Make prediction : Intialize the model and make prediction . To check the predictions are accurate calculate r2 error make sure r2        error should be greater than 0.5.

5) Calculate Residues : To check how much difference is present between train values and predicted values .

## Learnings from the project :

After completing this project, I now have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, I have applied the following concepts.

1) Train-test split

2) Correlation between the features

3) Linear Regression

4) MSE and R2 Evaluation Metrics
